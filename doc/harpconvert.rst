harpconvert
===========

Convert a product from its original format to a HARP compliant netCDF/HDF4/HDF5
file that can be processed further with other HARP command line tools. See the
section :doc:`Ingestion definitions <ingestions/index>` for an overview of the
product types supported by HARP.

::

  Usage:
      harpconvert [options] <input product file> <output product file>
          Convert the input product to a HARP netCDF/HDF4/HDF5 product.

          Options:
              -a, --operations <operation list>
                  List of operations to apply to the product.
                  An operation list needs to be provided as a single expression.
                  See the 'operations' section of the HARP documentation for
                  more details.

              -o, --options <option list>
                  List of options to pass to the ingestion module.
                  Options are separated by semi-colons. Each option consists
                  of an <option name>=<value> pair. An option list needs to be
                  provided as a single expression.

              -f, --format <format>
                  Output format:
                      netcdf (default)
                      hdf4
                      hdf5

          If the ingested product is empty, a warning will be printed and the
          tool will return with exit code 2 (without writing a file).

      harpconvert --test <input product file> [input product file...]
          Perform an internal test for each product by ingesting the product
          using all possible combinations of ingestion options.

      harpconvert --list-derivations [options] [input product file]
          List all available variable conversions. If an input product file is
          specified, limit the list to variable conversions that are possible
          given the specified product.

          Options:
              -o, --options <option list>
                  List of options to pass to the ingestion module.
                  Options are separated by semi-colons. Each option consists
                  of an <option name>=<value> pair. An option list needs to be
                  provided as a single expression.

      harpconvert --generate-documentation [options] [output directory]
          Generate a series of documentation files in the specified output
          directory. The documentation describes the set of supported product

          from them.

          Options:
