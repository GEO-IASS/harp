* Added ingestion support for NPP-Suomi.

* Allow 'Conventions' global attribute to contain more than just a reference
  to HARP.

* Renamed O3MSAF codadef to ACSAF. When updating HARP, you should remove
  any existing O3SMAF-*.codadef files from your installation directory.
  Otherwise you will get 'detection rule for ... is shadowed by ... ' errors.

* Fixed issue with TES TL2CH4L ingestion.

* Updates to Aeolus, S5P, and QA4ECV product ingestions.

* Added harpmerge command line tool.

* Added regrid(), rename(), smooth(), derive_smoothed_column(),
  point_in_area(), and wrap() operations.

* Removed the harpprofile command line tool. Its functionality is replaced by
  the regrid() and smooth() operations.

  a list of filenames or a globbing pattern as parameter (which will return
  the result of harp.concatenate() on the imported/ingested products).

* Automatically set CODA definition path for HARP Python interface
  (path can be overruled with CODA_DEFINITION environment variable).

* The parsing of the operations string has been rewritten using flex/yacc.
  This has fixed several issues related to the parsing and execution of
  operations.

0.4 2016-10-16
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed wrong scaling factor in conversions related to the ideal gas law
  (10^2 vs. 10^-2) and barometric formula (10^-9 vs. 10^-6).

* Fixed error in algorithm to derive gravity from latitude and height.

* Fixed invalid sorting of collocation result file (which resulted in wrong
  results when performing a collocation resampling).

* Fixed wrong independent dimension length for altitude/pressure bounds for
  SCIAMACHY Level2 ingestion.

* Added apriori number density variables to SCIAMACHY Level2 ingestion.

* Added variable conversion from latitude/longitude per vertical profile point
  to single (mid-point) latitude/longitude for profile.

  they are dependend on latitude and longitude dimensions.

* Fixed crash in derived variable conversion for volume mixing ratio from
  mass mixing ratio (for total air).

* Changed dimension argument of 'flatten()' operation from string to
  identifier.

* Fixed issue where -inf/+inf valid_min/valid_max attributes could not be
  exported as float values in the Python harp.export_product() interface.

* When deriving latitude/longitude bounds from mid points, latitude is now
  clamped to [-90,90] and longitude is wrapped to [-180,180].

* Fixed volume mixing ratio unit for GEOMS-TE-UVVIS-DOAS-OFFAXIS ingestion.

0.3 2016-09-30
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The changes between 0.2 and 0.3 are extensive. The list below provides the
  most important aspects, but there are many more smaller changes that are not
  listed.

* HARP 'actions' are now called 'operations' and are now executed in a strict
  sequence. This means that you can now do things like:
    'derive(var); var < 10; exclude(var)'

* Added harpprofile command line tool that allows regridding and smoothing
  of vertical gridded data. 
  Also added harp_product_regrid_vertical_with_axis_variable(),
  harp_product_regrid_vertical_with_collocated_dataset(), and
  harp_product_smooth_vertical() to C interface.

* Added algorithm descriptions for the derived variable conversions to the
  HARP documentation.

* Introduced a more strict definition of variable names for the HARP data
  format. As part of this the list of supported species and associated naming
  has also been revised.

* Introduced strict separation between dry air and total/wet air. The default
  air density in HARP is now the total/wet air. Anything related to dry air
  should now be annotated as such in the variable name. As a result, 'dry_air'
  is now introduced as a species, and for mixing ratios the '_wet' postfix is
  removed and the '_dry_air' postfix is introduced.
  Derived variable conversions have been added for dry/wet conversion and for
  retrieving the needed 'molar mass' of total air.

* Added functionality to deal with HARP Datasets and Product Metadata to the
  public C library interface. The collocation result interface in the C
  libraryinterface has also been reworked to now work with HARP Datasets.

* HARP_ERROR_ACTION and HARP_ERROR_ACTION_SYNTAX have been renamed to
  HARP_ERROR_OPERATION and HARP_ERROR_OPERATION_SYNTAX.
  harp_product_execute_actions() has been renamed to
  harp_product_execute_operations().

* Added operation to flatten data in a certain dimension and added
  harp_product_flatten_dimension().

* Automatic detection of a product type when ingesting products now happens
  using CODA (using included codadef files with detection rules) for all
  products.

* harp_import_global_attributes() has been removed (its functionality is
  now captured by the new Product Metadata interface).

* Added public functions to allow raising/capturing of warnings in HARP:
  harp_report_warning(), harp_get_warning_handler(), harp_set_warning_handler()

* Added public functions to print product/variable structure and content:
  harp_product_print(), harp_variable_print(), harp_variable_print_data()

* Fixed issue in the HARP Python interface where using the value 0 for
  valid_min or valid_max did not work.

* Added concatenate() function to HARP Python interface.

* The 'include()' action/operation has been renamed to 'keep()'.

* The derived variable conversions are now properly split according to the
  dimension types of a variable. This also solves a problem where certain
  valid conversions where not included in a '--list-conversions' print.

* The derived variable conversions that produce uncertainty and covariance
  variables filled with NaNs from scratch have been removed.

* Added derived variable conversions for gridded data (i.e. variables that
  depend on the latitude and longitude dimensions).

* Removed variables flag_am_pm and flag_day_twilight_night and the conversions
  for flag_am_pm, flag_day_twilight_night, and flag_daytime. These conditions
  can all be determined by directly comparing against the solar angles.

* Added support for ingestion of GOMOS L2, SCIAMACHY L2, ECMF GRIB and TEMIS
  assimilated ozone data.

* Added 'species' ingestion option to the MIPAS L2 ingestion.

* Added support for MLS CH3Cl, CH3CN, and CH3OH products.

* Fixed issue in GEOMS ingestion where long variable names were truncated.

* Introduced convention that dimensionless quantities should have an empty
  'units' attribute string value. Only non-quantities should omit the 'units'
  attribute.

* Resolved incorrect correction for leap seconds in product ingestions.

* Covariance variables have been renamed from '*_cov' to '*_covariance'.

* The split of random/systematic for covariances has been removed.
  For ingested products that had such covariances, the random covariances are
  now retrieved as plain covariances and from systematic covariances only the
  trace is retrieved and provided as a systematic uncertainty.

* Added 'geopotential' as a supported quantity with conversions from/to
  'geopotential height'. Added HARP_UNIT_GEOPOTENTIAL.

* Renamed cloud optical thickness to cloud optical depth.

* Added '-a/--operations' option to harpdump.

* Support for HDF4 and HDF5 (for import/export) is now optional when building
  HARP, but still enabled by default.

0.2 2016-06-30
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added Python interface.

* CODA is no longer included as part of HARP, but is treated as a separate
  package, just like HDF4 and HDF5.

* The CMake build system can now be used to build HARP on Windows and create
  a binary installer (using WIX).

* Revised and renumbered error codes in C interface.
  Renamed HARP_ERROR_SCRIPT and HARP_ERROR_SCRIPT_SYNTAX error codes to
  HARP_ERROR_ACTION and HARP_ERROR_ACTION_SYNTAX. Changed HARP_ERROR_PRODUCT
  to either HARP_ERROR_INGESTION or HARP_ERROR_IMPORT depending on context.
  Added HARP_ERROR_EXPORT, HARP_ERROR_INVALID_PRODUCT and
  HARP_ERROR_INVALID_VARIABLE.

* The HARP command line tools now link against the dynamic HARP library
  instead of the static version.

* Updated embedded expat library to version 2.1.1.

* Updated embedded udunits2 library to version 2.2.20.
  Also removed the HARP specific udunits XML configuration file since all
  HARP units are now included in udunits2.

* Renamed all 'stdev' variables to 'uncertainty'.

* Fixed parsing of dimension names; string dimension could be interpreted as
  independent dimension.

* Improved the efficiency of the conversion from volume mixing ratio to number
  density and vice versa.

* Update of S5P L2 ingestion module to the lastest version of the product
  format specification (S5P-KNMI-L2-0009-SD and relevant DLR PUMs).

* Update of S5P L1B ingestion module to the lastest version of the product
  format specification (S5P-KNMI-L01B-0012-SD).

* Added ingestion modules for the following product types:
    - Ozone CCI L2 limb profile
    - Ozone CCI L3 limb profile
    - Ozone CCI L2 nadir profile
    - Ozone CCI L3 nadir profile
    - Ozone CCI L4 nadir profile
    - Ozone CCI L2 total column
    - Ozone CCI L3 total column

* Added public functions harp_get_fill_value_for_type(),
  harp_get_valid_min_for_type(), harp_get_valid_max_for_type(),
  harp_is_fill_value_for_type(), harp_is_valid_min_for_type(),
  harp_is_valid_max_for_type(), harp_ingest_test(),
  harp_doc_list_conversions(), harp_doc_export_ingestion_definitions(),
  harp_geometry_get_point_distance(), harp_geometry_has_point_in_area(),
  harp_geometry_has_area_overlap(), harp_basename(),
  harp_product_execute_actions(), harp_variable_set_description(),
  harp_variable_set_unit(), harp_variable_set_string_data_element(),
  harp_variable_verify(), harp_product_set_source_product(),
  harp_product_set_history(), harp_product_verify()

* Added public functions for dealing with HARP collocations.

* Moved defines for default harp units to harp.h.

* Added operators =& and !& to the product actions to test integer variables
  against a bit mask, where a =& mask is equivalent to (a & mask) != 0 and
  a !& mask is equivalent to (a & mask) == 0.

* Added functions to verify the internal consistency as well as compliance to
  HARP conventions of harp_product and harp_variable instances. Any instance
  of harp_product returned by harp_import() or harp_ingest() has been verified
  using these functions.

* Added derived variable conversion from 'latitude {latitude}' (mid-points) to
  'latitude_bounds {latitude, independent}' (bounds); similar for longitude.

* Updated HDF5 data format such that HDF5 products written by HARP are
  compatible with netCDF-4. HDF5 dimension scales are used to represent shared
  dimensions. The "dims" dataset attribute has been deprecated.

* Changed netCDF-3/HDF4/HDF5 backends to be more explicit about implicitly
  created dimensions (which are used to store scalars and strings for formats
  that do not support this natively).

* Fixed handling of scalars and empty strings in netCDF-3/HDF4/HDF5 backends.

* Fixed unit attribute name in HARP products ('unit' -> 'units').

* Changed all constants to be in line with CODATA 2014 as published by NIST.

0.1 2015-11-09
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* First beta release (using CODA 2.15).
