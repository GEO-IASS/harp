                HARP 0.5 Release Notes


HARP is a toolset for ingesting, processing and inter-comparing satellite or
model data against correlative data. The toolset is composed of a set of
command line tools and a library of analysis functions. The main goal of HARP
is to assist in the inter-comparison of data sets. By appropriatelty chaining
calls to the HARP command line tools one can preprocess satellite, model,
and/or correlative data such that two datasets that need to be compared end
up having the same temporal/spatial grid, same data format/structure, and
same physical unit.

This version of HARP is still a beta release. HARP still lacks a few
components (see below), but these are planned to be added in the near future.

The main functionalities of HARP are:
 - ingestion of product data for:
   - ADM-Aeolus L1b/L2a/L2b
   - Aura OMI/TES/MLS/HIRDLS L2 + OMI L3
   - ECMF GRIB (includes CAMS global model data)
   - ENVISAT GOMOS/MIPAS/SCIAMACHY L1/L2
   - ERS GOME/GOME-2 L1/L2
   - ESA CCI: Aerosol, GHG, Ozone
   - EUMETSAT GOME-2/IASI L1/L2
   - GOSAT FTS L1/L2
   - IASI L1/L2
   - NDACC FTIR/Lidar/MWR/UVVIS-DOAS data (GEOMS format)
   - ODIN OSIRIS/SMR L2
   - Sentinel 5P L1/L2
   - TEMIS ozone fields
 - import/export of data from/into HARP-specific data format
   The HARP data format standard is a convention on top of netCDF3/HDF4/HDF5
   similar to netCDF-CF (and can be used in conjunction with netCDF-CF).
 - advanced filtering of product data
 - automatic unit conversion of quantities using udunits2
 - automatic generation of quantities ('derived variables') based on
   available product data: you just say which quantity you want, and if HARP
   has an algorithm for it and the necessary inputs quantities are in the
   product, HARP will automatically do all calculations for you
 - performing regridding operations
 - vertical smoothing of atmospheric profiles
 - built-in AFGL86 and USSTD76 climatology data
 - C Library interface to all core functionality
 - direct ingestion/import/export interfaces for:
   - Python
   - MATLAB (Linux + Mac OS X)
 - command line tools harpcheck, harpcollocate, harpconvert, harpdump,
   harpfilter, and harpmerge
 - extensive documentation, including specification of algorithms used for
   the variable derivations.

Note that HARP is meant as a successor to the BEAT-II interface of the ESA
Atmospheric Toolbox, which means that BEAT-II will at some point become
deprecated and will no longer receive updates.
